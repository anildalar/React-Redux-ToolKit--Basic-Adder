https://react-redux.js.org/

Create a basic counter (add,reset,subtract) with help of RTK


npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
npm install react-redux


What we have been doign previously to createStore object

import { createStore } from 'react-redux';
let store = createStore(p1,p2,p2);
p1= reducerFunction
p2 = initialState
p3 = enchancerFunc i.e middlewares

Now we are using RTK 

import { configureStore } from 'react-redux';
let store = configureStore({
	//1.P:V
	//2. Methods
})

only one JS object




Lets create 2 pages navigate with react-router-dom
page1 - add,reset,sub
page2 - fullcalculator
with RTK


For Unit Testing


something.spec.js
something.test.js
